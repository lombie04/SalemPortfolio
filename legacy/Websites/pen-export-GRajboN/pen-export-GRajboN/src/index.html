       <p class="p2"> Zimbabwe is home to one of the largest and most beautiful naturally occuring falls in the world called the Victoria Falls or Mosi-Oa-Tunya which translates to the Smoke that thunders. This name is backed up by the fact that due to the pressure exerted by the waterfalls the Victoria Falls are always rumbling and are surrounded by an evergreen rainforest which is a sight to behold.</p>
